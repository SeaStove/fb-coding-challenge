Using React, Semantic-UI, react-router-dom, and axios

4 main components are App.js, ArtistList, ARtist, and ArtistDetails

Overall I'm pretty happy with the UI, error handling, and logic. The only thing I'm unhappy with in this implementation is the artist popout and routing. It works, but it's not polished and doesn't access url parameters. If I had more time that's what I would spend it on first. I noticed an 'indexOf' error started firing randomly from Object.attrObserver when clicking the artists after adding routing, need to investigate.
